This was a separate inquiry from our investigation on rain, but nonetheless we pursued these idea and obtained some interesting results. 
\n\n We split our data into two groups, taxi rides that were paid in cash, and taxi rides that were paid by credit card; we felt this was an important step because we expected rides paid by cash to have somewhat under-reported tips and did not want to lump these two groups together.
We expected Manhattan to broadly have the highest average tip, but surprisingly tips were generally higher outside of Manhattan. There were even two outliers in Manhattan for zones Upper East Side North and Union SQ with a tip of percentages of 3.2% and 10.8 % respectively

st.markdown('''We wanted to investigate relationships between the different neighborhoods in NYC, so we created a heatmap for the top 50 relationships for pick up and drop off locations. To pull out underlying relationships, such as subnetworks and connections between the groups of pickup and drop-off locations, we used a clustering algorithm to arrange the locations on each axis by similarity.''')
st.markdown('''The similarity was computed using Euclidean distance, and the inherent patterns within the charts can be interpreted as subnetworks between different neighborhoods. For example, the blue square in the upper left corner of each plot represents a strong subnetwork between the Upper east Side North and Upper east Side South zones. Similar interpretations can be made for other observed patterns in the below charts (patterns of shapes and consecutive strips).
This method was repeated for single passenger rides, double passenger rides, and multi passenger rides.
